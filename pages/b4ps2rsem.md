# Burnout Revenge - Single Event Mod

![b4sem](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/498f859a-16b7-47e8-8c7f-0264e35d18cd)

## About

This mod replaces the **Multiplayer** option with a brand new **Create Game** (single event) option.

It lets you choose between the following one player game modes:
- Race
- Road Rage
- Traffic Attack
- Crash
- Burning Lap
- Eliminator

Modifying the menus and preserving a "vanilla" look has been tough but I'm quite proud of the end result.  
A lot of function hooks were implemented to make the game handle everything correctly (menus, new options, etc.).

I wanted to make this patch available for all regions of the game thus I used as much localized strings as possible.  
Only a few are still hardcoded in english.

## Install

Follow the [install instructions](https://github.com/Nahelam/PS2-Game-Mods/blob/main/README.md) and make sure to delete/disable the previous WIP Single Event patch.

## Extras

### Profile Save

After each event you will have the choice to save your profile data or not.

### Burning Lap -> Time Attack

Burning Lap mode behavior has been changed to Time Attack:
- No lap limit
- Personal best shown
- Lap marker enabled

### Finish Session

You can end the current event from the pause menu in
- the Burning Lap mode after performing at least one lap.
- the Traffic Attack mode when the time limit is disabled and your score is > 0.

### Opponent Limit

In Race and Eliminator modes you can choose up to **99** opponents.  
The "active" opponents limit is still **5**, they will be adjusted according to your position.  
The "adjusting" mechanic was only working properly in Race mode, support for Eliminator has been added.

### Lap Limit

In Race mode you can choose up to **99** laps.  
The "Hit Count" HUD component from Crash mode has been used to display 2 digits laps properly.  
The default lap HUD component couldn't display more than 1 digit.

### Insane Traffic Checking

My favorite one, when the **Traffic Checking** option is set to *Insane* you will be able to check all the traffic.  
You can check the same traffic vehicle until it vanishes.  
Each time you touch a traffic car with enough speed it will count as a check.  
Opponents are also given that power but they can't take you or other drivers down with traffic.
